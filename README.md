Notable functionalities:

        - Dynamic Asset Management:In order to maintain scalability and avoid hardcoding values, the application uses a dynamic asset management system. All assets are imported and exported via a centralized assets/index.js file. These assets are then used in the    constants/index.js file, where they are programmatically referenced / mapped throughout the app.
        - Logic and State Management: The application leverages React hooks to manage hover states and toggle the navigation bar, using logic to ensure smooth interactivity and dynamic UI behavior. Functions like toggleNavigation and handleClick control the opening/closing of the navbar for a seamless user experience.
        - Bento Box Layout: Implemented a bento box-style layout to provide a clean, organized, and visually appealing user interface. This design pattern enhances user experience by offering a structured, modular presentation of content.
        - Modern Design: The application leverages modern design principles, including minimalist aesthetics, smooth animations, and intuitive navigation, ensuring a contemporary and user-friendly experience across all devices.
        - Custom Illustrations: Integrated custom illustrations to enhance visual engagement and complement the overall design, adding a unique, polished touch to the user interface.
